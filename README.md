# Here is final project for CSE 543T Algorithms for Nonlinear Optimization

Our porject is **Text Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews**

Contributors: **Chengjiang Xia Jushen Wang Zijie Liu Yuchuan Wang Yan Zhou**

We use six NLP models and three optimzers to test how much different optimizers actually affect the training of the model.
Our data from [IMDb datasets](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/)

To make sure our project is working, we reran all the code today, and there may be some slight differences compared to the results of the previous run on which our report is based.a

## Model

* FastText
* TextCNN
* RNN
* BERT
* Embedding Network
* GCNN

## Optimizer

* SDG
* Adam
* AdamW
